Plan out the data model for the following solution in a salesforce org: 

Business Problem: A retail company is losing money due to stockouts and slow re-ordering processes. They need a system to visualize inventory and automatically generate purchase orders for suppliers. ROI: Prevents revenue loss from empty shelves and reduces manual administrative time by 40%.

The Tech Stack Implementation
LWC (The Modern Interface): Build a "Product Gallery" component.

Function: Displays products in a grid with images, current stock levels, and a "Restock" button.

PD1 Skill: Use @wire to fetch data and Imperative Apex to handle the "Restock" button click. Learn to use the Lightning Data Service (LDS) to update records without Apex where possible.

Aura (The Wrapper/Utility): Create a "Quick Adjust" Utility Bar component.

Function: A widget always visible at the bottom of the screen allowing warehouse staff to scan a barcode (simulate by typing a text ID) and increment/decrement stock.

PD1 Skill: Learn Application Events in Aura to communicate updates to other parts of the page.

Visualforce (The Legacy Requirement): Create a "Purchase Order" Generator.

Function: A page that takes a list of products needed and renders them as a clean, printable PDF invoice using renderAs="pdf".

PD1 Skill: Standard Controllers and Controller Extensions.

Backend Logic
Apex Trigger: Prevent stock from going below zero.

Batch Apex: Run a nightly job that identifies all products below the "Minimum Level" and creates a "Purchase Order" record automatically.

Notes:
- Changed name of Purchase Order object to AutoNumber PO-{0000}.
- Made the Order date field of the Purchase order object a Date/Time field instead of just a Date field.
- Set the default value of the Current Stock field of the Product object to 0.
- Created a prompt template called Barcode Generator that generates an automatic barcode for each product that is being created. 
- Created 13 dummy products and used Data Loader to insert them from a csv file. 
- Used static resource in order to store the images for the products and referenced the static resources in the Product_Image__c URL field.
- Created a validation Trigger on Product2 object prevents the value of Current_Stock__c going below 0. Used a Trigger Handler. 
- Wrote a basic unit test and also used a TestDataFactory to set up my test data. 
- Created an App called Smart Inventory System which will host lightning components.
- Changed Org currency to ZAR.
